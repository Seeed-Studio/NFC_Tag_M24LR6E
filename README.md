[Grove - NFC Tag](https://www.seeedstudio.com/s/Grove-NFC-Tag-p-1866.html)

Grove - NFC Tag is a highly integrated Near Field Communication Tag module,this module is I2C interface,which base on M24LR64E-R,M24LR64E-R have a 64-bit unique identifier and 64 -Kbit EEPROM.Grove - NFC Tag attach an independent PCB antenna which can easily stretch out of any enclosure you use, leaving more room for you to design the exterior of your project.

### Features

##### *I2C interface* #####
+ Two-wire I2C Serial interface supports 400KHZ protocol
+ Single supply voltage: 1.8V ~ 5.5V
+ Byte and Page Write(up to 4 bytes)
+ Random and Sequential read modes
+ Self-timed programming cycle
+ Automatic address incrementing

##### *Contactless interface* #####
+ ISO 15693 and ISO 18000-3 mode 1 compatible
+ 13.56 MHz Â± 7 kHz carrier frequency
+ To tag: 10% or 100% ASK modulation using 1/4 (26Kbit/s) or 1/256 (1.6 Kbit/s) pulse position coding
+ From tag: load modulation using Manchester coding with 423 kHz and 484 kHz subcarriers in low (6.6 kbit/s) or high (26 kbit/s) data rate mode. Supports the 53 kbit/s data rate with Fast commands
+ Internal tuning capacitance: 27.5 pF
+ 64-bit unique identifier (UID)
+ Read Block & Write (32-bit blocks)

##### *Memory* #####
+ 64-Kbit EEPROM organized into:
 1. 8192 bytes in I2C mode
 2. 2048 blocks of 32 bits in RF mode 
+ Write time
 1. I2C: 5ms(max)
 2. RF: 5.75 ms including the internal Verify time
+ More than 1 million write cycles
+ More than 40-year data retention
+ Multiple password protection in RF mode
+ Single password protection in I2C mode
